## Why Build a Design System?

After working on multiple projects, I noticed a recurring pattern: I was rebuilding the same components over and over. Buttons, inputs, modals, cards — the same patterns, slightly different each time. That's when I decided to build dkcodec-ui.

## Architecture Decisions

### Component API Design

The most important decision was the component API. I wanted something that felt natural to React developers while being flexible enough for different use cases.

```tsx
// Simple and intuitive API
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">
  Click me
</Button>

// Composable pattern for complex components
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Content here</CardContent>
</Card>
```

### TypeScript First

Every component is fully typed with TypeScript. This provides autocomplete in editors and catches errors at compile time rather than runtime.

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### Tree-Shaking Support

The library is built with tree-shaking in mind. Each component is a separate module, so bundlers only include the components you actually use.

## Publishing to NPM

The publishing workflow uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

1. Version bump and changelog generation
2. Build the library with Rollup
3. Run type checking and linting
4. Publish to NPM registry

## Lessons Learned

- **Start small** — ship a few solid components rather than a huge, untested library
- **Documentation matters** — Storybook made the library usable for others
- **Versioning is important** — follow semver strictly to maintain trust
- **Listen to users** — the best improvements came from community feedback

The library now has 500+ weekly downloads, and it's been a great learning experience in open-source maintainership.
